							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<h2>GSS was using the same Wordpress template since 2009.</h2>
							<p>Green Shirt Studio's mission has been to create a safe and inclusive space where people can try out or hone their acting skills. While their WordPress website had served them well since 2009, it was time to address some ongoing issues that have plagued them the past couple of years.</p>
							<p>Years of feedback from students, and concerns from the staff had them concerned that their current design and registration process was deterring new students. Our goal was to simplify the class registration process, condense the site's information architecture, and update their brandâ€™s visual design.</p>
							<p>First, this case study will go over the process of creating a new class registration process (problem #1), then it will transition into the process of redesigning the brand and UI (problem #2). Bear in mind that both processes occurred in tandem to one another.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h4>Problem #1: Class Registration</h4>
							<h2>We worked together to discover why this was a problem.</h2>
							<p>Early on, I gathered as much information about how registering for classes could be frustrating. Through a website audit and discussions with the GSS staff, I learned in the class registration workflow that to complete your transaction you had to exit the site to go to a PayPal gateway. Oftentimes, students wouldn't have a PayPal account or transactions wouldn't finalize for whatever reason, and the GSS staff would end up finalizing transactions manually on their end.</p>

							<h3>Class Labels&nbsp;&#38;&nbsp;Business Strategy</h3>
							<p>Part of understanding the class registration workflow included shifting through their class catalog for labels. Inadvertently, creating this visual diagram helped the client visualize the gaps between class sessions, which helped formed their business strategy and model going forward.</p>

					<!-- Information Architecture & User Workflow -->
					<div class="content-child">
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Information Architecture&nbsp;&#38;&nbsp;User Workflow</h3>
							<p>I facilitated both user interviews and an open card sort because we wanted to determine the most important pages that could help persuade a user to register for classes. The insight of the audit, interviews, and card sort test helped me narrow down the number of parent categories we needed for the site map. Additionally, we operated under the assumption that the new class registration workflow should work internally to avoid potential drop-off. This meant transitioning away from PayPal, and using a Stripe gateway instead.</p>

							<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
							<p>I facilitated a usability test with past and present students to validate the class registration concept, our copy, and verify any usability issues. Looking back, it was probably wasn't ideal to use copy as means to validate our brand concept. Even though I explicitly told users to that we were operating at a lower fidelity on purpose, I would still receive feedback on color, type, and button choices. Ultimately, we mostly validated the main task, and identified potential usability issues.</p>

							<h4>Final Output</h4>
							<h2>Leading up to launch, we had an issue with our visual builder.</h2>
							<p>With not a lot of time to code the front-end from the ground-up, we resorted to using another plugin to solve our issue. The tradeoff with the switch was the inability to customize WooCommerce (or shop) pages. This meant my high-fidelity designs couldn't be fully represented in the final output. We had to compromise. In the end, I could make subtle changes to the WooCommerce CSS, but unfortunately this added to a more bloated code.</p>

Then voila, classes reappear and disappear on their own based on their stipulated start/end dates.</p>

							<h4>Reflection</h4>
							<h2>The biggest thing I learned from this project was the importance of collaboration. </h2>
							<p>As the sole proprietor of this project, I found myself in a flow where I would present work to the client, receive feedback, then rinse and repeat. While I was fortunate that the client fully trusted my decision-making, and wasn't particularly picky with my choices, I found it more helpful to work together than apart.</p>
							<p>For example, later on in the project we would whiteboard some ideas for the UI. Doing this helped the client feel more ownership over the process, and excitement for the project. I wish I spent more time at the beginning setting up expectations on what a human-centered design process looks like and how they could benefit from it.</p>
							<p>Additionally, I wish I advocated for the scope to include some time to test and iterate after deployment. This could have been a period to address any potential usability issues that may arise from launch.</p>
