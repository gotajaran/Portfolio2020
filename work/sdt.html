							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<h2>Healthcare admins use Strata’s StrataJazz SaaS product to plan for the next fiscal year.</h2>
							<p>When healthcare administrators plan for their next fiscal year, it happens over a series of meetings and requires input from different departments. In other words, you can’t plan it all in one sitting and there are a series of “phases” that the planning undergoes. Below are screen caps of different actions users can facilitate in this module.</p>
							<p>The problem was that these seemlingly related actions were faciltiated across different pages. My Product Manager wondered, why couldn’t they be on the same page?</p>

							<img src="../images/sdt/SDT-Functions.png" alt="Examples of actions found in the SaaS platform">
						</div>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Additionally, clients requested specific actions that could only be done on the back-end. These actions could not be developed for Stratajazz because specific actions were not appropriate for certain phases. While keeping Stratajazz flexible, it also needed parameters to avoid user error.</p>
							<p>Our goal was to create a new feature in the current module. It’s purpose was to recommend specific actions throughout phases in the budget planning process.</p>

							<h4>Onboarding Exploration</h4>
							<h2>I spent my first week trying to understand the problem we were trying to solve.</h2>
							<p>Throughout the project I created a series of visuals to affirm what my Product Managers taught me and what I understood from exploring the current product. For instance, these visuals are task flows; left is detailed, right is the abridged version.</p>
							<p>The problem was that these seemlingly related actions were faciltiated across different pages. My Product Manager wondered, why couldn’t they be on the same page?</p>
							<p>Initially, it seemed that I was going to simply add a new page that contained links to all the actions. However, what happened was a series of conversations of different implementation considerations. The following shows the evolution of our understanding of the concept of “phases.” Ultimately, our goal was to figure out how can we translate this idea of “phases” into an interface?</p>

							<h4>Ideation</h4>
							<h2>Exploring different ways we can incorporate the concept of “phases.”</h2>
							<p>Some ideas included using tabs to represent each phase, using modes to contain phases, and incorporating a “stepper” to indicate which “phase” you were on.</p>

					<!-- Actions Content -->
					<div class="content-child">
						<div class="content">
							<p>From these sketches we realized we needed to clarify what current actions will be included, what new ones we want to create, and the conditions each action has through every phase. My Product Managers created this matrix of 33 actions we wanted to include in Confluence.</p>
						</div>

					<!-- Wireframes Content -->
					<div class="content-child">
						<div class="content">
							<p>After clarifying the actions, and having an idea of what we wanted, next I needed to figure out how to organize these actions. These mid-fi wireframes explored different ways I wanted to hide/show actions. For example, if one action is recommended for the first phase and not recommended for the second phase but we still want the user to have access to it, how do I indicate that using similar assets throughout each phase? Here I played with visibility, modals, and accordions.</p>
							<p>Ultimately, we decided that this accordion-based design that contained the relevant actions for each phase best fit our objective. We wanted a design that looked consistent throughout each phase, provided us flexibility to move actions based on changing conditions, didn’t overwhelm the user with too much information, and gave us the least amount of the time to create new assets and deploy for development.</p>

							<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
							<h2>We really hoped this made sense to our clients.</h2>
							<p>We wanted to know if our concept resonated with our client’s experience and to identify usability errors in the design. The first part of the test we showed a picture of the stepper and asked questions to verify their experience, and for the second part I created an interactive prototype and had the client facilitate a series of tasks.</p>
							<p>All you need to know is that I gathered quantifiable data like if users could locate specific functions and identified consistent patterns in their experience and feedback. Fortunately we validated our idea and felt ready to move forward with the UI design.</p>

							<h4>Reflection</h4>
							<h2>I mocked up the UI before the project ended.</h2>
							<p>Here’s one concept of the final design that utilized current design assets and followed their in-development design system. The things I had to create or figure out was the stepper, the container for the actions, and the accordion icon.</p>
							<p>Throughout this internship I learned to think more critically about my designs. My biggest takeaway from this experience was taking time to think about how I can design towards our objectives rather than mindlessly moving assets without fully understanding the problem we were trying to solve.</p>		
							<p>Additionally, I learned more about my role in conjunction with a group. My quick diagrams helped guide the conversation towards our goal and you don’t know what you don’t know until you know.</p>
